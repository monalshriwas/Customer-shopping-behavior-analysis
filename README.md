# Customer-shopping-behavior-analysis

End-to-end customer behavior analysis using SQL, Python, and Power BI with business-focused KPIs and dashboards.

#Project Overview

- This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover insights related to revenue performance, purchasing patterns, and customer satisfaction.
- The analysis follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python for data cleaning & EDA, SQL for analysis, and Power BI for visualization.

The goal is to demonstrate practical analytics skills and business-oriented decision-making using real-world style data.

# Business Objective

- To help stakeholders answer key questions such as:

- How much revenue is generated?

- What is the average order value?

- Which customer segments contribute most to revenue?

- How satisfied are customers with their purchases?

- How do subscribed and non-subscribed customers differ?

#  Dataset Description

- The dataset contains customer-level shopping data, including:
 
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Age Group)
 
- Purchase details (Category, Quantity, Purchase Amount)
 
- Subscription status
 
- Review ratings
 
- Seasonal and payment behavior


# Tools & Technologies

- Python – Data cleaning & exploratory data analysis (EDA)
 
- SQL – Data analysis and aggregation
 
- Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, and dashboard creation
 
- Excel / CSV – Source data
 
- GitHub – Version control & documentation

# Project Workflow
## Data Cleaning (Python)

Performed using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy.

### Key steps:

- Checked and handled missing values
 
- Verified data types
 
- Created new features (e.g., Age Group)
 
- Standardized categorical values
 
- Validated numerical columns (purchase amount, ratings)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Python

- EDA was conducted to understand data distribution and patterns:

- Customer distribution by age group and gender

- Purchase amount distribution

- Category-wise purchase behavior

- Rating distribution

- Subscription vs non-subscription comparison

- These insights guided KPI selection and dashboard design.

# Data Analysis (SQL)

-SQL was used to perform structured analysis and aggregations such as:

- Total revenue calculation
 
- Customer counts
 
- Category-level revenue analysis
 
- Subscription-based revenue contribution
 
- Rating aggregation
 
- This step ensured query-based analytical thinking and business logic validation.

# Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to present insights clearly and effectively.

## Key KPIs

- Total Revenue

- Total Customers

- Average Order Value (AOV)

- Average Review Rating

- Subscriber Revenue Percentage


# Dashboard Features

- KPI cards for quick performance overview
 
- Category-wise and demographic analysis
 
- Subscription vs non-subscription comparison
 
- Clean and minimal visual design
 
- Business-focused storytelling

# Key Insights

- Average order value and revenue per customer are identical due to single-order granularity

- Certain product categories contribute disproportionately to overall revenue

- Subscribed customers account for a higher share of revenue

- Customer satisfaction remains consistently positive across most segments
